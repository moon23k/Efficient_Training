## Lightening_Ablation

Most of the recent research is focused on increasing the size of the model to get better performance.

Large sized models have a better expressive ablility, there is a strong tendency to drive good performance. However, it brings problem that the calculation cost becomes excessively high.

To mend this problem, this repo covers how to keep the model lightweight while still maintaining acceptable performance.
